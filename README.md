Network Traffic Analysis Assignment

Assignment Overview

This project involves analyzing web server logs to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security concerns within network traffic. The analysis focuses on understanding user behavior, request distribution, and system performance.

- Analysis Objectives

The primary objectives of this assignment were to:

Analyze request patterns and distribution
Identify potential security threats or anomalies
Evaluate system performance based on response codes
Recommend improvements based on findings

- Methodology

My approach to this assignment included:

Statistical analysis of request methods (GET vs POST)
Temporal analysis to identify patterns across different days and hours
IP-based analysis to detect unusual behavior
Status code evaluation to identify system issues
Anomaly detection through statistical modeling

Tools Used
Linux command-line tools (awk, grep, sort)
Python for data processing and statistical analysis
Markdown for report formatting

- Key Findings


The analysis revealed:

Highly asymmetric distribution of request methods (99.52% GET requests)
Clear diurnal patterns in traffic volume
Several potentially anomalous IP addresses exhibiting unusual request volumes
Moderate error rate (2.20%) with specific temporal patterns
Evidence of potential automated scanning activity



This assignment was completed for Advanced Network Security (CS4562) - Spring 2025
